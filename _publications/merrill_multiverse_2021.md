abstract: Data analyses are based on a series of “decision points” including data
  filtering, feature operationalization and selection, model specification, and parametric
  assumptions. “Multiverse Analysis” research has shown that a lack of exploration
  of these decisions can lead to non-robust conclusions based on highly sensitive
  decision points. Importantly, even if myopic analyses are technically correct, analysts’
  focus on one set of decision points precludes them from exploring alternate formulations
  that may produce very different results. Prior work has also shown that analysts’
  exploration is often limited based on their training, domain, and personal experience.
  However, supporting analysts in exploring alternative approaches is challenging
  and typically requires expert feedback that is costly and hard to scale.

description: Data analyses are based on a series of “decision points” including data

  assumptions. In this work we mine Kaggle for hundreds of thousands of decision points
  and train a novel language model to suggest alternative analyses.
