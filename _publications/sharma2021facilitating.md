description: Access to mental health care is a global challenge that online peer support
  platforms like TalkLife can help mitigate. Millions of people seek and provide support
  online but they struggle to have effective conversations. In this paper, we work
  towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce
  empathic rewriting, a new task for transforming low-empathy conversations to higher
  empathy. We propose PARTNER, a deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to
  make sentence-level edits to conversations in order to increase the expressed level
  of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through specificity, fluency,
  and diversity.
