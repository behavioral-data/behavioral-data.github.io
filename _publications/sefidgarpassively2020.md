abstract: 'A deep understanding of how discrimination impacts psychological health
  and well-being of students could allow us to better protect individuals at risk
  and support those who encounter discrimination. While the link between discrimination
  and diminished psychological and physical well-being is well established, existing
  research largely focuses on chronic discrimination and long-term outcomes. A better
  understanding of the short-term behavioral correlates of discrimination events could
  help us to concretely quantify such experiences, which in turn could support policy
  and intervention design. In this paper we specifically examine, for the first time,
  what behaviors change and in what ways in relation to discrimination. We use actively-reported
  and passively-measured markers of health and well-being in a sample of 209 first-year
  college students over the course of two academic quarters. We examine changes in
  indicators of psychological state in relation to reports of unfair treatment in
  terms of five categories of behaviors: physical activity, phone usage, social interaction,
  mobility, and sleep. We find that students who encounter unfair treatment become
  more physically active, interact more with their phone in the morning, make more
  calls in the evening, and spend more time in bed on the day of the event. Some of
  these patterns continue the next day. Our results further our understanding of the
  impact of discrimination and can inform intervention work.'
