abstract: Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated important changes in online
  information access as digital engagement became necessary to meet the demand for
  health, economic, and educational resources. Our analysis of 55 billion everyday
  web search interactions during the pandemic across 25,150 US ZIP codes reveals that
  the extent to which different communities of internet users enlist digital resources
  varies based on socioeconomic and environmental factors. For example, we find that
  ZIP codes with lower income intensified their access to health information to a
  smaller extent than ZIP codes with higher income. We show that ZIP codes with higher
  proportions of Black or Hispanic residents intensified their access to unemployment
  resources to a greater extent, while revealing patterns of unemployment site visits
  unseen by the claims data. Such differences frame important questions on the relationship
  between differential information search behaviors and the downstream real-world
  implications on more and less advantaged populations.

description: The pandemic prompted increased digital engagement for health, economic, and educational resources. Analyzing 55 billion web searches across 25,150 US ZIP codes, we found differing use of digital resources based on socioeconomic and environmental factors. Lower-income areas accessed health information less than higher-income ones. ZIP codes with more Black or Hispanic residents used unemployment resources more, with unique patterns. These disparities raise important questions about the impact of information search behaviors on disadvantaged populations.
