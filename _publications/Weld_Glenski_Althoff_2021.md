abstractnote: As civil discourse increasingly takes place online, misinformation and
  the polarization of news shared in online communities have become ever more relevant
  concerns with real world harms across our society. Studying online news sharing
  at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which is shared by
  millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore, existing research
  has largely focused on specific communities or specific interventions, such as bans.
  However, understanding the prevalence and spread of misinformation and polarization
  more broadly, across thousands of online communities, is critical for the development
  of governance strategies, interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct
  the largest study of news sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million
  links spanning 4 years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact
  Check to annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness.
  We find that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have
  105% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links to
  relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit usersâ€™ voting
  and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely biased and
  low factual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30% fewer exposures from
  crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This suggests that reddit
  is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We show that extremely biased
  and low factual content is very concentrated, with 99% of such content being shared
  in only 0.5% of communities, giving credence to the recent strategy of community-wide
  bans and quarantines.

description: Studying news shared online is challenging due to the massive volume of content which is shared. In this work, we conduct the largest study of news sharing to date, analyzing more than 550 million links to news articles posted on reddit over four years. Using non-partisan news source ratings of sources' political bias and factualness, we find that up- and down-voting mechanisms generally decrease the visibility of biased and low factual content, and that such content is very concentrated, being mostly shared in only a small fraction of all communities.
