abstract: 'Mental health stigma prevents many individuals from receiving the appropriate
  care, and social psychology studies have shown that mental health tends to be overlooked
  in men. In this work, we investigate gendered mental health stigma in masked language
  models. In doing so, we operationalize mental health stigma by developing a framework
  grounded in psychology research: we use clinical psychology literature to curate
  prompts, then evaluate the models{''} propensity to generate gendered words. We
  find that masked language models capture societal stigma about gender in mental
  health: models are consistently more likely to predict female subjects than male
  in sentences about having a mental health condition (32{\%} vs. 19{\%}), and this
  disparity is exacerbated for sentences that indicate treatment-seeking behavior.
  Furthermore, we find that different models capture dimensions of stigma differently
  for men and women, associating stereotypes like anger, blame, and pity more with
  women with mental health conditions than with men. In showing the complex nuances
  of models{''} gendered mental health stigma, we demonstrate that context and overlapping
  dimensions of identity are important considerations when assessing computational
  models{''} social biases.'

description: If you have ever considered using NLP for Mental Health applications,
  itâ€™s vital to know what the models have inadvertently learned about people with
  mental health issues. In our EMNLP 2022 paper, we find that masked LMs capture societal
  stigma about gender in mental health.
