abstract: Detailed mobile sensing data from phones, watches, and fitness trackers
  offer an unparalleled opportunity to quantify and act upon previously unmeasurable
  behavioral changes in order to improve individual health and accelerate responses
  to emerging diseases. Unlike in natural language processing and computer vision,
  deep representation learning has yet to broadly impact this domain, in which the
  vast majority of research and clinical applications still rely on manually defined
  features and boosted tree models or even forgo predictive modeling altogether due
  to insufficient accuracy. This is due to unique challenges in the behavioral health
  domain, including very small datasets (\textasciitilde 10\^1 participants), which
  frequently contain missing data, consist of long time series with critical long-range
  dependencies (length{$>$}10\^4), and extreme class imbalances ({$>$}10\^3:1).
