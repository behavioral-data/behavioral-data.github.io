abstract: Drawing reliable inferences from data involves many, sometimes arbitrary,
  decisions across phases of data collection, wrangling, and modeling. As different
  choices can lead to diverging conclusions, understanding how researchers make analytic
  decisions is important for supporting robust and replicable analysis. In this study,
  we pore over nine published research studies and conduct semi-structured interviews
  with their authors. We observe that researchers often base their decisions on methodological
  or theoretical concerns, but subject to constraints arising from the data, expertise,
  or perceived interpretability. We confirm that researchers may experiment with choices
  in search of desirable results, but also identify other reasons why researchers
  explore alternatives yet omit findings. In concert with our interviews, we also
  contribute visualizations for communicating decision processes throughout an analysis.
  Based on our results, we identify design opportunities for strengthening end-to-end
  analysis, for instance via tracking and meta-analysis of multiple decision paths.
