We are a research group at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science of Engineering](http://cs.washington.edu). Our aim is to explore and understand behavioral through the lense of data science.

The Behavioral Data Science Group develops computational methods that leverage large-scale behavioral data to extract actionable insights about our lives, health and happiness through combining techniques from data science, social network analysis, and natural language processing. We currently work on research related to mental health, misinformation online, scientific reproducibility, and informing the COVID-19 response.

We have a [postdoc position](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h44Gz1wOMx6QhHUWv9QFB3Jnrn-JzEMPHC0WZhPMEqU/edit#) available.

We are also looking for PhD students, especially in but not limited to deep learning, causal inference, data science and mobile health. If you're interested please apply to the UW Allen School. Go Dawgs!
